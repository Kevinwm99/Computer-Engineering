    " $$ M_1= GaussI\\\\ M_2 = LinLog \\\\ \\Rightarrow L(M_1) \\le L(M_2) $$\n",

    " where $(w,w_0)$ is the weight vector which define the decision boundary plan on the input spacce $x$ and L is the same as the cost function of LogReg. Therefore $L(M_1)\\le L(M_2)$\n",

    " $$ M_1= LinLog\\\\ M_2 = QuadLog \\\\ \\Rightarrow L(M_1) \\le L(M_2) $$\n",

    "  $$ M_1= GaussI\\\\ M_2 = QuadLog \\\\ \\Rightarrow L(M_1) \\le L(M_2) $$\n",
    "  This is due to $L(M_{GaussI}) \\le L(M_{LinLog}) \\le L(M_{QuadLog})$\n",
    "\n",
    "  e. It is true because all the models are based on decision boundary and a sigmoid and the scores L gets better as the instances are forced into the correct region of the boundary. Due to the shape of the sigmoid function, its derivative is bigger around 0.5 than at the extrmes where the function is satureated. Therefore when we maximize the cost function we will decrease R."
